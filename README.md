# Project Documentation

### Project Description and Scope

I will be using telecoms data to analyse and visualise how crowd size changes over time in specific locations. This can be in the form of a time series or 
showing the most recent data. The work should display different demographics within each area and compare them over time. I can create a simple dashboard 
that updates in time with how the data is created and let users choose which demographics they want to see displayed.

### Learning Aim

The aim is to use Spark in R Studio, explore more Spark transformations, and link this learning to developing real-time dashboards that run smoothly. 

### Project Data

The telecoms dataset shows the number of people per specific demographic combinations (age, gender, and purpose). This data is at the 'Middle layer super
output' level, which contains roughly 7000 shapes that cover the UK. The data is split by 5 minute intervals for each area, and the dataset is 234.53GB
of logical bytes (uncompressed data). The data contains valuable information on how different demographics travel depending on certain events. The velocity 
at which the data is created and the value it brings to the organisation can class it as Big Data.

### Business Questions

I can use this data to uncover patterns in travel of different demographic groups, or how specific large-scale events impact travel. In this case, I will
be looking at how train strikes affect travel, particularly the purpose of travel. 

### Resources - Cloud / On Premise / Costing

Reflect on the resources you have used, and what costs you might incur if your solution were to be scaled up.  You may make use of online costing tools 
for Azure or other platforms.  How does running your solution in the cloud compare to having dedicated on-premise equipment dedicated to this processing?  
This is really a focus on ROI (Return on Investment).  What return will be derived given the investment made (fixed cost and marginal cost).

### Reflection

What went well, and what did not not go so well?  What have you learned that you can take forward into your workplace or future career?  Are there any 
new projects you might now be able to tackle?  Justify which grade you have aimed for with reference to the marking rubric. You may achieve more by 
challenging yourself, and learning from failure rather than doing something safe.  You need to set your own goals and evaluate the extent to which you 
have met them.
