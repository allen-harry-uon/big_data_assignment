# Project Documentation

### Project Description and Scope

I will be using telecoms data to analyse and visualise how crowd size changes over time in specific locations. This can be in the form of a time series or 
showing the most recent data. The work should display different demographics within each area and compare them over time. I can create a simple dashboard 
that updates in time with how the data is created and let users choose which demographics they want to see displayed.

### Learning Aim

The aim is to use Spark in R Studio, explore more Spark transformations, and link this learning to developing real-time dashboards that run smoothly. 

### Project Data

The telecoms dataset shows the number of people per specific demographic combinations (age and gender, spend power and purpose). 
At the most detailed, this data is at OA (Output area), the smallest form of geography from the ONS geographies. The data is updated hourly, 
while not being currently updated there is purpose to developing a project that handles this update timeframe as this has been the case in past projects. 
The volume of data, almost 2TB of logical bytes (uncompressed data), should classify this dataset as Big Data. The data also contains valuable information, 
showing us how different demographics are travelling around the country, which is particularly useful when certain events (e.g. King's coronation) 
affect travel patterns. 

### Business Questions

I can use this data to uncover patterns in travel of different demographic groups, or how specific large-scale events impact travel. 

### Resources - Cloud / On Premise / Costing

Reflect on the resources you have used, and what costs you might incur if your solution were to be scaled up.  You may make use of online costing tools 
for Azure or other platforms.  How does running your solution in the cloud compare to having dedicated on-premise equipment dedicated to this processing?  
This is really a focus on ROI (Return on Investment).  What return will be derived given the investment made (fixed cost and marginal cost).

### Reflection

What went well, and what did not not go so well?  What have you learned that you can take forward into your workplace or future career?  Are there any 
new projects you might now be able to tackle?  Justify which grade you have aimed for with reference to the marking rubric. You may achieve more by 
challenging yourself, and learning from failure rather than doing something safe.  You need to set your own goals and evaluate the extent to which you 
have met them.
